My ability to use tools like Tableau for effective data visualization, along with experience in MLflow for model tracking, underscores my commitment to delivering actionable insights through meticulous analysis.

My proficiency in evaluating model performance, coupled with a strong foundation in statistical testing, has equipped me to tackle the challenges of data quality and algorithmic bias. I am adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams, having interacted with business analysts, and data engineers in previous roles.
